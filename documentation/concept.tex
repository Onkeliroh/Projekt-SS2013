\section{Concept}
\subsection{Basic Concept}
Feet are used in many real world tasks together with the rest of the body, but in computer environments they are almost completely put aside as an interaction possibility \cite{pakkanen}. For instance, Ubicomp researches have developed different types of interfaces for public spaces where users' hands are the protagonists and feet are partly or completely neglected. 

The basic concept of this project is a feet-based interface whose \textbf{individual modules} react when pushed or kicked. For this purpose, modules have to be highly \textbf {mobile} to yield a flexible interaction with the user. Another desired aspect is \textbf {expandability}: the envisioned system will allow the integration of new modules and features. Finally, a module is expected to detect if a another module comes up against it. In other words, another feature in the envisioned system is the \textbf{interaction between modules}. 

\subsection{Hardware Concept}
To achieve \textbf{modularity} and \textbf{mobility}, a wireless communication platform is fundamental.   
Panstamps \cite{panstamp} are small boards intended for implementing custom wireless networks. In their boards, Panstamps have an integrated transceiver, the CC1101 \cite{cc1101}, that makes the wireless communication possible. 

Due to Panstamps' open source nature, documentation and information about already implemented projects with them is at hand for everyone on the internet; this represents a very important advantage over other wireless products in the market. Furthermore, Panstamps' core is the the ATMEGA 328 \cite{atmega328}; therefore, they are entirely programmable from the Arduino IDE, whose community is increasing each day.

For all these reasons, our envisioned system is based on Panstamps. As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:server-module}, each module in our system is constituted by a sensor and actuator node, both having a Panstamp as their nucleus. The server node has also a Panstamp as its main component, which communicates wirelessly with the other modules' panstamps. 

The Java Server gets the data recollected by the server node, process it and gives a response to the server node that has to be sent to the appropriate node in the network. The feedback provided by the Java Server depends entirely on the \emph{personality} of each device (module).

\end{figure}



To detect if they have been kicked or pushed, modules need to sense their own movement; therefore, an accelerometer is connected to the sensor node of each module as shown by Figure \ref{fig:sensor-node}. We used the ADXL335 \cite{ADXL335}, a small accelerometer that measures acceleration in each of the cardinal directions (x,y and z).

Each module has a led strand constituted by led-and-controller pairs. To produce a certain light pattern, the actuator node, which is connected to the strand (see Figure \ref{fig:actuator-node}), sends information to each controller to indicate whether its led should be on or off and what color has to be displayed. Led patterns play an important role in the interface because each module expresses its \textbf{personality} through led patterns.  

The \textbf{interaction between modules} is based on proximity; that is, a module triggers a reaction in other module when it is close to it. In our implementation, the closeness between two modules is determined by measuring the RSSI of broadcasted messages in the network. The RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. The longer the distance travelled by a radio wave the bigger its intensity loss.

All the elements in a module are powered by a 11 volts Li-Po battery. This battery should not be over-discharged, for this reduces drastically it's life. Therefore, sensor nodes have an integrated voltage-monitoring circuit (see Figure \ref{fig:sensor-node}) that detects the  low-battery state.

\subsection{Software Concept} 
\subsubsection{Java server}

The Java Server is the heart of the interface; it is the orchestrator of all nodes in the system's network. The server node transfers all the data gathered in the network to the Java Server, which produces a response according to each module's personality and sends it to the intended actuator nodes through the server node (See Figure~\ref{fig:server-module}).  

The Java server's main functions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to provide an interface that allows the configuration of modules' personalities
\item to analyse data transmitted by the sensor nodes
\item to generate responses to the sensed stimulus by sending commands to the actuator nodes
\item to store modules' personalities
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Driver} 
Since we used the Arduino IDE to program the Panstamps, all the nodes' drivers in the network were written in C++. These drivers were designed to allow \textbf{expandability}; as a result, new nodes can be added to the network by coping the basic drivers and changing them slightly. 

In short, the drivers are in charge of:
\begin{itemize}
\item enabling the wireless communication
\item managing the communication between different nodes
\item handling the information provided by sensors 
\item operating the led strands
\item setting up the communication with the Java Server on the Panstamp' side
\end{itemize}
