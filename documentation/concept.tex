\section{Concept}

\subsection{Basic Concept}
The basic concept for this project was to create a interface, which is modular and mainly mobile. Like already explained we wanted to create a interface that has more degrees of freedom in terms of the usage than a installation which is bound to a place and therefor mobile. Due to the fact that we decided to use a more powerful server to manage all devices, we reached a certain degree of bounding to a place, while still being mobile. 

\subsection{Hardware Concept}
%hardware, advantages of microcontrollers, engery problems, wireless stuff

\subsection{Software Concept} 
To achive the degree of mobility, the server only needs a connected panstamp to work properly. It is also possible to put the server software on a more powerful microcontroller like a raspberry pi or some similar controller.
The modularity is given through a number of easy configurable files. Changing behavior, apperance or the defined actions is pretty easy to do.
