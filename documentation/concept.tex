\section{Concept}

\subsection{Basic Concept}
The basic concept for this project was to create an interface, which is modular and mainly mobile. Like already explained we wanted to create a interface that has more degrees of freedom in terms of the usage than a installation which is bound to a place and therefor mobile. Due to the fact that we decided to use a more powerful server to manage all devices, we reached a certain degree of bounding to a place, while still being mobile. 
So a server - client - structure is a very broad system and maybe to powerful for the target of this project. But in fact we needed a system that is highly extendable to add new features use it in another project.
First idea was to build several independent hardware devices which communicate between each other. But the usage of a server - client based system has plenty more advantages than to build a simple hardware - communication - system:
It is easier to implement new functionalities or to use this environement for later projects. Furthermore an administrator can change the device defaults pretty easy using the Graphical Interface.   
\subsection{Hardware Concept}
%hardware, advantages of microcontrollers, engery problems, wireless stuff

\subsection{Software Concept} 
To achive the degree of mobility, the server only needs a connected panstamp to work properly. It is also possible to put the server software on a more powerful microcontroller like a raspberry pi or some similar controller.
The modularity is given through a number of easy configurable files. Changing behavior, appearance or the defined actions is pretty easy to do.

The system contains the different hardware devices and the server. The communication is enabled by using panstamps. When one of the devices gets activated by e.g. kicking it, the accelerometer sensor will trigger an input sending it to the panstamp. There a packet will be created which contains the ID of the device, the intensity of the cinetic input and a checksum bit at the end.

Those data will be send to the panstamp of the server where this data will be analyzed and compared to the corresponding personality of the device. The personality then outputs the behaviour for the device. A behaviour consists two colors (which can be the same) and a pattern. This pattern describes the appearance of the colors. (Like a blinking or fading of the diodes)
