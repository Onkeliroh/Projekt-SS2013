\section{ABSTRACT}
The project described in the presented work consists of a network of wireless nodes with a star topology. The main node is constituted by two entities: a computer with a Java-based server and a panstamp device, both of them interconnected. 

The Java-Server is meant to manage all devices and provide tool for configuration the appearance and the behavior. Therefore, we created a Datastructur allowing the user to create own setups for the devices and simply configuring them. We also wanted the user to get a quick and completed overview of all necessary informations at once.
A main concern of the server architecture was the extensibility of our work for upcomming projekts. The structure provides easy access to all parts of the server and does not require mutch changes in related files to take effect.
