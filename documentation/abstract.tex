\section{ABSTRACT}
The project described in this work consists of a network of wireless nodes with a star topology. The main node is constituted by two entities: a computer with a Java-based server and a panstamp device, both of them interconnected. The rest of the nodes are divided into two types: sensor and actuator nodes; the former gathers information and sends data to the main node while the latter receives data from the main node and reacts to it accordingly. The Java-Server manages all network nodes depending on the recollected data, and provides an interface to allow users the configuration of different settings in the network. With the interface, users can create their own setups and get a quick and complete overview of the network status.The sensor and actuator nodes are grouped in pairs to form independent entities in the network and each one
of these entities reacts differently to each possible situation. The Java-server determines the personality of each entity.
