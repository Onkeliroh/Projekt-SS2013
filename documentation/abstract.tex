\section{ABSTRACT}
In this work, we explain the implementation of a distributed interface for public spaces where feet play the main role. Users interact with the interface by pushing or kicking the individual modules that constitute the system and each module reacts to the stimulus differently;that is, each one of them expresses a different~\emph{personality}. In this system, a server orchestrates all the modules 

Each individual module is made up of a sensor and an actuator node; the former gathers information and sends data to the server while the latter receives data from the server and reacts to it accordingly. The server is constituted by two entities: a computer with a Java-based server and a server node, both of them interconnected. With the server node as the core, all actuator and sensor nodes establish a wireless network with a star topology, where the information is mainly transferred between a node and the server. The Java-Server manages all network nodes depending on the recollected data, and provides an interface to allow users the configuration of different settings in the network. With the interface, users can create their own setups and get a quick and complete overview of the network status. The Java-server determines the personality of each entity. 

We present summaries of related projects and then describe the technical development of our foot-based interface, its final structure and how it works.
