\section{ABSTRACT}
The Java-Server is meant to manage all devies and provide tool for cofiguration the apperence and the behavior. Therefor we created a Datastructur allowing the user to creat own setups for the devices and simply configuring them. We also wanted the user to get a quick and completed overview of all nessesary informations at once.
A main concern of the server architecture was the extensibility of our work for upcomming projekts. The structure provides easy access to all parts of the server and does not require mutch changes in related files to take effect.
